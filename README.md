###The Station
The International Space station is a collaboration between 26 countries to maintain a platform for space exploration and research. Flying 400km above the surface of the Earth, it is the largest and most visble man-made object in space and can be seen from almost anywhere on the planet as it completes an orbit every 90 minutes.

###The Learning Objective
EMU propulsion system for EVA rescue.

###The Scenario
Astronaut Swanson has experienced a failure of the SAFER propulsion system after an anomalous event propelled them away from the ISS during a maintenance exercise. Buddy, the player, must use their own emergency propulsion system to safely navigate their way to the stranded astronaut, and bring her back to safety.
