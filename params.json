{"name":"International Space Station Rescue Mission","tagline":"","body":"###The Station\r\nThe International Space station is a collaboration between 26 countries to maintain a platform for space exploration and research. Flying 400km above the surface of the Earth, it is the largest and most visble man-made object in space and can be seen from almost anywhere on the planet as it completes an orbit every 90 minutes.\r\n\r\n###Where is the ISS Right Now?\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.satflare.com/export/xvsft.asp?k=1&q=25544&w=500&h=300&z=2\"></script>\r\n\r\n###The EMU\r\nThe Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) is an advanced spacesuit which provides mobility and life support to astronauts performing extravehicular activity (EVA) or \"spacewalks\" outside the ISS and the retired NASA Space Shuttle. Since 1994, the suits have been equipped with Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) propulsive backpack systems, which provide astronauts with a means of returning to the spacecraft if they become untethered during a spacewalk. \r\n\r\n###The Learning Objective\r\nUnlike its predecessor, the Manned Maneuvering Unit, the SAFER system is intended for emergency use only. It has only been used once in a test at its introduction. It has never been used in a live emergency, nor has it been purposed for operations other than self-rescue. In this simulation, an astronaut is presented with a situation in which they must repurpose their SAFER system to rescue a fellow spacewalker. This operation will help users learn about the ISS and the dangers astronauts face while perfroming EVA.\r\n\r\n###The Scenario\r\nAstronaut Swanson has experienced a failure of the SAFER propulsion system after an anomalous event propelled her away from the ISS during a maintenance exercise. Buddy, the player, must use their own emergency propulsion system to safely navigate their way to the stranded astronaut, and bring her back to safety.\r\n\r\n###The Simulation\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDDnuZAL9ps\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n###Presence\r\nImplementing an effective training simulation demands a high sense of presence. To create a convincing environment, we used models of the ISS and EMUs developed in collaboration with NASA. The player has a body so that when they look down they can see their suit and propulsion system and really 'feel' in the hotseat. One of the main purposes the sim is to accustom the user to making their way around outside of the station, so we have implemented movement which simulates the difficulty of navigating in a zero gravity environment. If the astronaut is not careful and runs into a rail, they can easily send theirself into a dangerous tumble, jeopardizing the mission and their life. Finally, while we originally wanted to use real mission audio, we decided on crafting our own situation-appropriate radio chatter, so that instructions were received 'through the player's earbud.'\r\n\r\n###Virtual Reality and the Future in Space\r\nCurrently, astronauts complete their first spacewalk in a VR lab. EVA is inherently dangerous, and it pays to have as much experience as possible under the belt before setting foot outside the Space Station. In the future, that danger could be eliminated through the use of remotely-controlled robots. Equipped with pressure and temperature-sensitive touch, they could be operated with sophisticated motor control by astronauts from within the ISS for inspection and delicate maintenance. Additionally, samll camera drones could be used with VR to provide a spacewalk experience for non-astronauts in space education and outreach programs.\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgements\r\nISS and EMU model provided by [NASA and Dark Side of the Jam](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/756).\r\n\r\nEarth model from [Planet Earth Free](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/23399).\r\n\r\n[Rope physics](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/3D_Physics_Based_Rope).\r\n\r\n[Rigid body reorientation](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/417920/how-to-make-a-rigidbody-rotate-towards-an-object-u.html).\r\n\r\nAmanda Swenson as Astronaut Swanson.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
